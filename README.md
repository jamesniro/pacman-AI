# Pacman-AI
### This folder contains my project for CSE 471. I implemented the following graph algorithms to accomplish this assignment and navigate Pacman successfully through the maze
1. Depth First Search (closed list) 
2. Breadth First Search (closed list) 
3. Uniform Cost Search and A* algorithms.  
### Additionally, I implemented the Astar algorithm to navigate the maze and expand the fewest node 
### possible.
